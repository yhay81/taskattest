# Releasing TaskAttest

Only a release manager named in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) may release.

1. Confirm the version is unpublished and `CHANGELOG.md`, `Cargo.toml`, and
   `Cargo.lock` agree.
2. Confirm the release commit is on `main`, the worktree is clean, and every
   required check passes.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   cargo fmt --check
   cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
   cargo test --all-targets --locked
   cargo package --locked --allow-dirty
   cargo build --release --locked
   target/release/taskattest schema --document brief --format json
   ```

4. Dogfood a clean representative repository. Verify both a `passed` receipt
   and an intentionally `incomplete` or failed receipt offline, including all
   referenced log blobs.
5. Confirm Linux, macOS, Windows, the Rust 1.85 MSRV, RustSec audit, schemas,
   documentation links, and package contents in CI.
6. Create and push a signed annotated tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -s v0.2.0 -m "TaskAttest 0.2.0"
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```

7. The release workflow creates native archives, completions, a CycloneDX SBOM,
   `SHA256SUMS`, a GitHub release, and GitHub/Sigstore build provenance and SBOM
   attestations.
8. In a clean directory, verify downloads:

   ```bash
   sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
   gh attestation verify taskattest-v0.2.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz \
     --repo yhay81/taskattest
   gh attestation verify taskattest-v0.2.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz \
     --repo yhay81/taskattest \
     --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
   ```

9. Extract every archive and run `taskattest --version`, completion generation,
   `schema --document brief --format json`, and discovery against a synthetic
   Git repository.
10. Release notes must link to installation, checksums, SBOM, provenance,
    changelog, configuration, receipt limits, and security reporting.

Publishing to crates.io remains manual until registry ownership and credentials
are configured:

```bash
cargo publish --locked
```

Never move or reuse a published tag or version. A failed release is followed by
a documented patch release.
